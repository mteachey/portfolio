                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I am one of those rare, truly well-rounded, good-at-it all individuals. I am an experienced  front-end developer who loves getting knee deep in code and coming up hours later. I have a knack for designing, eye-loving layouts with an intuitive understanding of good user-experience. On top of all of that, I am good at connecting and communicating with people....I really have it all!</p>

                <p>I have been working as a developer, honing my skills for four years now. For two of those years, I was a website manager and developer for a high-paced marketing firm. I was their lead developer on several site refreshes and new sites and managed over 50 websites on various CMSs and platforms. Currently, I am free-lancer, creating client-pleasing websites, applications and experiences for clients.</p> 
                     
                <p>Before pursuing my love of code, I was a middle school science teacher and chemical engineering graduate from Virginia Tech. I have had the fortune to live and work in such amazing cities New York and Washington, D.C., as well as, small, mountain towns like Boone, NC. I currently call Denver, CO my home and love it! When I am not working with code, you can usually find me enjoying the outdoors with my dog and a pair of hiking shoes or a bike.
