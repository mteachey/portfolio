                            <h2>Process</h2>
                            <p>This is a custom Wordpress site with custom plugins, calls to several APIs and lots of user interactivity to make a content heavy site easy and enjoybale to use.</p>
                    
                            <p class="work-description">I was the lead developer for building this twenty page, interactive site.</p>
                            <p>Some of the challenges to overcome with this site were due to the budget for the site and the large number of locations (over 700) and separate operating companies (thirteen) that made up the corporation. Many of the cost saving plugins we used for different functionality - such as the location map, timeline, and operating company page - required lots of customization and clever hacking. </p>
                            <p>The company also wanted dynamic stock information, current market cap and stock price, as well as, news postings. This required making an API call to retrive and display most current values for this data.</p>
                            <p class="work-description">The designer and I created a beautiful UI with all the functionality the client wanted while also launching the site on time and on budget.</p>
                            <p class="note">Aggregate Materials is an alias and there is no live link to this site to respect a NDA.</p>
