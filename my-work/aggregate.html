                            <h2>Process</h2>
                            <p>This site was developed with custom plugins, calls to several APIs and lots of user interactivity to make the content-heavy site easy and enjoyable to use.</p>
                    
                            <p class="work-description">I was the lead developer for building this twenty-page, interactive site.</p>
                            <p>Some of the challenges to overcome with the site were due to the budget for the site and the large number of locations (over 700) and separate operating companies (thirteen) that made up the corporation. Many of the cost-saving plugins we used to add different functionality - such as the location map, timeline, and operating company page - required lots of customization and clever hacking to make them work for the 700+ locations.</p>
                            <p>The company also wanted dynamic stock information, including their current market cap and stock price, as well as, news postings. This required making an API call to retrieve and display the most current values for this data.</p>
                            <p class="work-description">The designer and I created beautiful UIs with all the functionality the client wanted while also launching the site on time and on budget.</p>
                            <p class="note">Aggregate Materials is an alias and there is no live link to this site to respect an NDA.</p>

                            <p class="work-description">The "Next Page" buttons were added to the site after user-feedback testing. The "Careers" page and some of the sustainability content were added during stage 2 of this site, as well as, a few tweaks to the main menu.
