                                <blockquote>"Melinda has been such a pleasure to work with! From the first initial meeting, she gathered our ideas, hopes, and wishes for our website and she took that information and came up with a website that we love! She listened to our feedback and reworked some things until we were completely satisfied with the final product. She is very patient and always willing to help us understand things. She is very creative and so energetic about what she loves to do, which is hard to come by these days. Anytime we have had questions, she is always there to lend a hand and willing to fix the problem. If there has ever been a time where she needed to do some work on our site, she let us know beforehand and when she was done, just to keep us informed, which is very much appreciated! I would recommend Melinda to anyone wanting a creative, fun, and supportive web designer!"
