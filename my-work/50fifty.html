                        <blockquote>"Melinda has been such a pleasure to work with! From the first initial meeting, she gathered our ideas, hopes, and wishes for our website and she took that information and came up with a website that we love! She listened to our feedback and reworked some things until we were completely satisfied with the final product. She is very patient and always willing to help us understand things. She is very creative and so energetic about what she loves to do, which is hard to come by these days. Anytime we have had questions, she is always there to lend a hand and willing to fix the problem. If there has ever been a time where she needed to do some work on our site, she let us know beforehand and when she was done, just to keep us informed, which is very much appreciated! I would recommend Melinda to anyone wanting a creative, fun, and supportive web designer!"

                            <h2>Process</h2>
                            <p>Mandy and Chris wanted a visual concept for their website that was simple and elegant to reflect, but not compete with, their amazing desserts.</p>
                            <p>They wanted a website where customers could go to see enticing images of their desserts, find important contact information, and learn a little about them and their dream that is 50/Fifty Desserts.</p>
                            <p>The project required both the design of the visual concept and the development of the site; as well as, creation of graphic elements, image selecting and editing; and editing the textual content.</p>
                            <p class="work-description"></p>
                            <p>I spoke with Mandy and Chris about their goals and vision for their business and website in order to create a number of different design concepts for them to choose between. It was during our first meeting to look at potential designs when listening to both what Mandy was saying and trying to say about the designs that I came up with the final design concept we would use for their site.  I then developed a custom theme for the site using the Joomla platform.</p>
                            <p>I created some of the graphic elements, such as the background image, for the site using Illustrator.  I selected and edited the images that would be used for the site using Photoshop. I assisted Mandy and Chris with editing the textual content to keep marketing goals and SEO in mind.</p>
                            <p>There is one call to their stock API that was coded to enable their current stock price to be dyanmically listed at the top of the site. This has since been removed. </p>
